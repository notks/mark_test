## Introduction

Secure File Sharing addresses the need for a robust and secure mechanism to exchange files within our app. This feature is designed to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access and ensure that files remain confidential throughout the sharing process.

## Key Features

- **End-to-End Encryption:** All files are encrypted before being uploaded and can only be decrypted by the intended recipient.
- **Access Control:** Users can specify access permissions, limiting who can view or download shared files.
- **Audit Trail:** The system logs all file-sharing activities, providing an audit trail for security and compliance purposes.

## Implementation

### Encryption

Files are encrypted using the AES-256-GCM encryption algorithm. This ensures that even if the file data is intercepted during transmission, it remains unreadable without the appropriate decryption key. The encryption key is securely generated and managed for each file, enhancing security.

### Access Control

Access control is implemented through a permission system. When a user shares a file, they can specify which other users or groups have access to the file. Permissions include read-only or download access, ensuring that only authorized individuals can view or retrieve the shared file.

## Usage

### File Upload

1. Navigate to the "File Sharing" section of the app.
2. Click on the "Upload" button.
3. Select the file you want to share.
4. Specify the recipients and their access permissions.
5. Click "Share" to initiate the upload process.

### File Download

1. Access the "File Sharing" section of the app.
2. Locate the desired shared file.
3. Click on the file to view its details.
4. If you have the necessary permissions, a "Download" button will be available.
5. Click "Download" to retrieve the file.

## Integration with Existing Systems

The Secure File Sharing feature provides APIs for seamless integration with third-party systems. Developers can use these APIs to incorporate file sharing functionality into their applications or workflows. Detailed API documentation can be found in the [API Reference](api-reference.md) file.

## Security Considerations

To maintain the highest level of security:

- Regularly update encryption algorithms to adhere to industry best practices.
- Implement multi-factor authentication to enhance user access controls.
- Conduct regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

## Future Improvements

We are committed to continuous improvement. Future updates to the Secure File Sharing feature may include:

- Support for additional encryption algorithms.
- Integration with external key management services.
- Enhanced reporting and analytics for file-sharing activities.

## Support and Troubleshooting
