## Implementation

### **WebSocket Integration**

The magic behind real-time collaboration is our WebSocket integration. This technology enables bidirectional communication between clients and the server, ensuring instantaneous updates.

```javascript
// Example WebSocket initialization
const socket = new WebSocket('wss://example.com/collab-doc');

socket.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  // Handle real-time updates
};

socket.onclose = (event) => {
  // Handle connection closure
};
